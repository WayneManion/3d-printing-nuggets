Nuggets of information mined via hours of frustration

mini 12864 displays from different manufacturers can have different EXP1/EXP2 header layouts. If your new display doesn't work, try putting the connector in backwards. You can do this by grinding the key off the connector or by pulling the plastic surround off the display PCB, rotating it around, and putting it back on backwards. The notch will now be on the other side. 

When BTT mentions an "FPC" connector, it most likely refers to an 18-pin, 1-mm pitch connector.
